# myhca-propped-doors
Being able to send real-time alerts of propped doors as well as create a record of them.
## Description
The Google form is used to both record that a door was found propped while students are present and to send a notification to the principals.
## Roadmap
I want the app to email the appropriate principal the name of the employee who allowed the door to be propped.
### What do we need to identify the "appropriate" principal?
We need the room number

We need the date and time

We need the schedule from Blackbaud

We need to verify if teacher had a sub
### Output Options
Output would look like the following:

Email sent to middle school/high school principal.

"Teacher Soand So's door, #223, was found unsecured during 1st period Biology on Tuesday, February 4, 2025 at 8:53 a.m."

"The door was resecured."
